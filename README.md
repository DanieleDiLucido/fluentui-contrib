# Fluent UI contribution packages

This repository hosts packages that are published under the `@fluentui-contrib/` scope. Contributor packages
are extensions of [Fluent UI](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui). There are many reasons to create contributor
packages some of which are:

* UI controls that are more specific than general primitives of a design system
* Extensions of existing Fluent UI controls with more extra features
* Incubator for upcoming Fluent UI core controls

## Contract

Contribution packages enable Fluent UI contributors and other Microsoft partners
use Fluent UI to create rich experiences that build on the design system, without
the requirements of the design system getting in the way. We give the initiative
to contributors to ship their packages with an API and support structure that makes
sense to them.

There are however a few housekeeping requirements that we impose on contribution packages:

* README authoring - please author the README.md file for your package to be helpful to users
* Documentation - each package should have documentation examples powered by Storybook
* Issues - be a responsible maintainer and address user issues for your package

Other than the basic housekeeping requirements, the contribution package sandbox for developers
to build on. The Fluent UI team is happy to work with contributors if they need help and
guidance.
